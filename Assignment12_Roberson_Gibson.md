Assignment 12
Gibson and Roberson

Owen Gibson

This assignment I learned the basics of load testing and how to find max load for a website as well as different strategies to increase our max load. I was surprised to see how tedious it was to test our max load and how often we got inconsistent numbers.

Ashley Roberson

This week I learned about how to load test a server. We used Locust and could find a max load by running a locust server under different conditions. I also learned about 10 ways to improve performance such as caching, using a reverse proxy server, and load balancing. I was surprised by how fragile the server is and how one change can either drastically improve the performance or break the server.
