The first major addition to the mqtt locust file was making sure that a random device_id was used for each different hatch. In order to do this I created 4 random integers. If the integer was between 10-15 then I converted those integers to string characters from "a" to "f" so that the hex values for the device_id's were valid. Now that on start every new hatch has a randomized device_id the first task was to publish to /lamp/changed. This is a topic that goes from LAMPI to EC2 with qos=1 and indicates that the lampi has changed state. The next task was to publish to /lamp/connection/lamp_ui/state indicating that the device is connected, "0" or "1". This was also with a qos=1. Finally, the task wait time was set to be between 5000 and 15000 ms.
