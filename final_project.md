# Introduction to Connected Devices - Final Project

## **Goals**

The Final Project will demonstrate understanding of the material and technologies from this semester’s lectures and assignments, and your ability to solve real-world problems using them, by building something novel.

## Format

* 1 or 2 students per team
* must submit **project proposal _and have proposal approved_**
* provide a **midpoint proof-of-feasibility** in-class demonstration
* work must be completed in order to present and turn in final deliverables during **Finals Week** 

## Important Dates

* Initial Proposal Due: **April, 4, 2018**
* Feedback on Proposal By: **April 9, 2018**
* Final Proposal Due: **April 11, 2018**
* Midpoint Proof-Of-Feasibility Due: **April 25, 2018**
* Final Presentation and Submission Due:  **Finals Week (date/time TBD)**

## Project Proposal
* the proposed project must be _novel_ and _challenging_ for students of the course
* the proposed project must be a _technical_ project, involving **one or more LAMPI devices** and **at least two** of the following:
    * Touchscreen (Kivy)
    * Pub/Sub (MQTT)
    * AWS
    * Web (HTML/CSS/JS/Websockets)
    * Django
    * Mobile (iOS)
    * Bluetooth Low Energy
    * Analytics
    * Secure, Remote Firmware Update
    * Load Testing and Scaling
    * Security
    * DevOps (Ansible)
    * (other - but only with strong justification and instructor approval)
* (see format below)

## Deliverables

1. Project Proposal (1 page)
    * Project Title
    * Names of Team Member(s)
    * Description of Proposed Project (1-2 paragraphs, images/figures if appropriate)
    * Scope - what is in scope?  what is out of scope?
    * Learning Goals - what do you hope to learn from completing this project?
    * Hardware and Software Required (particularly what you need that you don't already have access to)
    * Project Plan - Brielfy describe your project plan (tasks, etc.), including a minimal "walking skeleton"
    * Risks and Mitigation Plans
    * Midpoint - Proof of Feasiblity
        * What is a "walking skeleton" of minimal functionality to prove out the feasibility of your project that can be completed in 1-2 weeks?
1. Midpoint Demo (Proof of Feasibliity)
    * 1 Page Report
    * Demo Video ( <1 minute)
2. Final 
    * Final Report (1-2 pages; longer if data/reports/etc.)
        * Title
        * Team Members
        * Project Description
        * Project Plan
        * Process/Methods (What did you do?)
        * Results (What did you accomplish? if not the complete goal, why not?)
        * Conclusions (What did you learn?)
    * Final Slides (PDF, PPTX, Google Slides)
    * Presentation and Demo (5-10 minutes) - all team members must be present and actively participate
    * Demonstration Video
    * Code Submission (Git Pull Request)

## Sample Project Ideas

* Alexa Integration
* Google Home Integration
* IFTTT Integration
* Direct Voice Integration
* [Digital Twin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_twin)
* Light-based Alarm Clock
* [AWS IoT](https://aws.amazon.com/iot/)
* Build a Low-Cost LAMPI (e.g., Pi Zero W, ESP8266, etc.) that is compatible with current system

## Grading Rubric

The final project grade will make up 10% of your final grade.

Date:

| | Team Members (no more than 2) |
|-| ------------ |
|1|             |
|2|             |


| Component | Points Possible | Awarded | Low | Medium | High |
| --------- | --------------- | ------- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| Written Communication | 15 | | Overly brief, poorly organized, poorly written final report with many spelling and grammar issues | Final report mostly organized and clear, with some areas hard to follow; few spelling/grammatical errors | Well structured, clear, concise final report; few, if any spelling/grammatical errors |
| Presentation | 15 | | Slides contain errors and are poorly formatted; speakers inaudible; rely heavily on notes; unable to answer questions | Slides are mostly clear; speakers are mostly audible, with some use of notes; reasonable answers to most questions, but not all | Slides are error-free and logical; speakers are clear, audible, and fluent in their topic areas, and handle questions appropriately | 
| Demonstration | 20 | | Poor demonstration of the project; nothing works, and students are unable to debug/fix | Demonstration mostly works, but with some issues (e.g., reboots, long delays) | Flawless demonstration - student(s) clearly prepared and practised, and had anticipated contingencies |
| Problem Solving | 50 | | Student(s) completed little, if any of the project as outlined in the proposal | Student(s) completed most of the project as outlined in the proposal | Students completed the entire project as outlined in the proposal and demonstrated mastery of the topics |
| **TOTAL** | 100 |
